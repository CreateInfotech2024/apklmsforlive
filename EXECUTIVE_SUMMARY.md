## 🔧 Technical Solution Overview

### Three Core Fixes

#### 1. WebRTC Signaling Enhancement ✅
**Problem**: Messages didn't identify their sender  
**Solution**: Added sender ID to all WebRTC messages  
**Impact**: Proper message routing, connections succeed  

#### 2. Self-Connection Prevention ✅
**Problem**: Users trying to connect to themselves  
**Solution**: Validate sender before processing messages  
**Impact**: Eliminated wasted resources, cleaner connections  

#### 3. Media Quality Optimization ✅
**Problem**: Poor audio/video quality  
**Solution**: Enhanced constraints (echo cancel, noise suppress, optimal resolution)  
**Impact**: Excellent user experience
